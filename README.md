### Template Method Pattern
The Template Method defines the steps of an algorithm and aloows subclasses to provide the implementation for one or more steps.

### Holywood Principle

- Dependency Inversion Principle

Hollywood Principle gives us a way to prevent "dependency rot". Dependency rot happens when you have high-level components depending upon the low level components and so on. 
With the Hollywood Principle, we allow low-level components to hook themselves into a system, but the high-level components determines when they needed, and how. In other words, the high-level components give the low-level components the "don't call us, we'll call you" treatment.

### Composite Pattern
The Composite Patern allows youto compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
