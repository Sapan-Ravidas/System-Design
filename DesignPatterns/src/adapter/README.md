# Adapter 

Say's we'got an existing software system that you need to work a new vendor class library into,
but the new vendor designed their interfaces differently than the last vendor. 
We neither want to change our existing code nor we can do anything about the vendor's code.

The adapter acts as the middleman by receiving requests from the client and converting them into requests that make sense on the vendor class.

## Points to Consider
#### Object Adapter VS Class Adapter
#### Decorators VS Adapters
