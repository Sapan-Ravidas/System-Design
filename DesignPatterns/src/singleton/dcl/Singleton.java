/**
 * Javaâ€™s synchronized keyword guarantees both mutual exclusion and visibility. 
 * If we make the blocks of threads that modify the value of the shared variable 
 * synchronized only one thread can enter the block and changes made by it will be 
 * reflected in the main memory. All other threads trying to enter the block at the 
 * same time will be blocked and put to sleep. 
 * In some cases, we may only desire visibility and not atomicity. The use of 
 * synchronized in such a situation is overkill and may cause scalability problems. 
 * Here volatile comes to the rescue. Volatile variables have the visibility features 
 * of synchronized but not the atomicity features. The values of the volatile variable 
 * will never be cached and all writes and reads will be done to and from the main memory. 
 * However, the use of volatile is limited to a very restricted set of cases as most of the
 * times atomicity is desired. For example, a simple increment statement such as x = x + 1;
 * or x++ seems to be a single operation but is really a compound read-modify-write sequence
 * of operations that must execute atomically.
